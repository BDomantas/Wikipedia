# Contributing

We welcome patches and features. There are however a few things that are
required before your pull request can be merged. Make sure you cut a branch
from develop and all PRs pointed towards master.

# Tests

## How to write a new test case

For any new feature added, we expect a new test case. Since the repo has a 100% code coverage, we expect a success case test and a failure case test for each case. Read up more about why unit testing [here](https://dzone.com/articles/top-8-benefits-of-unit-testing).

## Running test cases

Make sure your PR passes all the tests by running `npm run test` before
raising a PR.
